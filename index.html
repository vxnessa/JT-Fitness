                        <p> Hi there! My name is Jack Murray. I am a young aspiring fitness professional dedicated to helping people achieve their fitness goals. I have 5 years of weight training experience including 6 years of sports/atheltics. I am from Toronto, Canada living in the Houston area. Currently a NASM Certified Personal Trainer with an outgoing personality that will make your training experience unique. I will be graduating Texas State University as a honor student with a degeree in Exercise Sports Science. 
                            I am a traveling trainer who will come to you at a fraction of the cost commercial gyms charge. After expoeriencing an ACL injury my football career was over and I lost my scholarship to Sam Houston University.I have been able to recover and found my passion
                             is to help motivate people live a healthier life.
